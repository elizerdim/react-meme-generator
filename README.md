### What I learned

I completed this project on Scrimba back in September 2023 when I was first learning React and wanted to include it here for reference.

- useId()
- An async function cannot be directly passed into useEffect because it automatically returns a Promise, and if a function passed into useEffect should either return nothing or a cleanup function. So the async function should be passed into useEffect inside an anonymous function.
